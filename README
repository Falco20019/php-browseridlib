(1) Summary

The library offers functions for verifying BrowserID assertions directly on the server
as relaying party. Verifying the assertions directly has the advantage that the assertion
is not sent over the internet and to reduce dependencies on others.

Since BrowserID is highly under developement right now, this library may be out 
of date the time you use it. Until the protocol get's stable, the usage is only 
advised for experimental usage. If you want to use BrowserID in the experimental 
state, it's recommented to use https://browserid.org/verify for verification.


(2) Requirements

This library uses anonymous functions and functions like openssl_get_md_methods that
are only available since PHP 5.3.0 Therefore you must use a version >= 5.3.0 for it
to work.


(3) Release notes

This library offers the working state as of 2011-07-06. All functions available at 
https://github.com/mozilla/browserid/tree/dev/verifier/lib were ported for usage
