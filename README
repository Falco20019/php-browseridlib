(1) Summary
-----------

The library offers functions for verifying BrowserID/Persona assertions directly 
on the server. Verifying the assertions directly has the advantage that the assertion
is not sent over the internet and to reduce dependencies on others.

Since BrowserID/Persona is highly under developement right now, this library may 
be out of date the time you use it. Until the protocol get's stable, the usage is 
only advised for experimental usage. If you want to use BrowserID/Persona in the 
experimental state, it's recommented to use https://browserid.org/verify for 
verification.

(See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Persona/FAQ#Can_I_verify_assertions_locally.2C_or_must_I_use_the_remote_verification_service.3F)


(2) Requirements
----------------

This library uses native JSON support and cURL. Therefore you must use a 
version >= 5.2.0 for it to work. Fallback JSON implementations may follow.
